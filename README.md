# Dotfiles_ArchBspwmnime
Yeah Hello everyone for use this dotfiles only copy this to your .config folder in your home folder and go to all folders of this dotfiles and in the main configuration file of this change the path to the files refired in them files for example: in the bspwmrc is refired /home/vertecedoc/walpapers/ArchB.jpg to the path of your user, for example: your user is Klolek in this case change /home/vertecedoc/walpapers/ArchB.jpg to /home/klolek/walpapers/ArchB.jpg and do it for all main config files though in the most config files won't be nesesary given that have ~ instead of /home/user

posdata: you need to move the folder wallpapers to your home directory and here is a somes wallpapers of anime, skyrim, archlinux, linux, zelda for chanche it you need to change the bspwmrc in the line of feh --bg-fill /home/vertecedoc/Wallpapers/ArchB.png & remplacing the word ArchB.png for the name of the wallpaper that you want for have 2 monitors comment the line 13 in the bspwmrc and uncomment the lines 9 and 10 of the bspwmrc file and change the word eDP1 and DP2 for the words of your monitor adapter to know that use the command xrandr -q and there will be the monitor adapters for example in my case:

Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1366 x 768, maximum 32767 x 32767 eDP1 connected primary 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 340mm x 190mm 1366x768 60.00*+ 1280x720 59.86 60.00 59.74 1024x768 60.00 1024x576 60.00 59.90 59.82 960x540 60.00 59.63 59.82 800x600 60.32 56.25 864x486 60.00 59.92 59.57 640x480 59.94 720x405 59.51 60.00 58.99 680x384 60.00 640x360 59.84 59.32 60.00 DP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) DP2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) HDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) HDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) VIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

so my first adapter is eDP1 and my VGA output is DP2 because this you need to change the adapters
